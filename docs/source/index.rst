RCS documentation
=================

No matter whether it is in simulation or in the
lab â€“ setting up robotics experiments is challenging, especially
if they target both types of deployments. While a plethora of
different robotics software frameworks exist, they usually make
a trade-off between complexity and versatility. Drawing from
this rich ecosystem, Robot Control Stack (RCS) is a
robotics software stack that is designed to resolve this conflict by
combining established robotics tools and frameworks through
a lightweight multi-layered API that unifies simulation and
real-world robot control.
